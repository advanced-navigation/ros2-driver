    # This is the setup for what ANPP Packets you wish to read from your
    # device. It must have an even number of entries
    # Every odd entry is the requested 'id' of the packet
    #   See ANPP Documentation for more information on packet types and 
    #   corresponding IDs
    # Every even entry is the requsted 'period' of the packet 
    #   The Number of Periods for each packet to be output from the device
    #   once. To find the frequncy for each packet use the following:
    #   Freq = 1000000/(Period * Packet Timer Period)
    #   e.g. 10,000 μs Period length and 10 periods per packet gives 10Hz
    # e.g. Requesting Packet 20 with a period of 50 is [20,50]
    packet_request: [20, 1, 28, 1]
    
    # The size of the packet period in Microseconds. 
    # Bounded to [1000-65535] [1000Hz-15.29Hz]
